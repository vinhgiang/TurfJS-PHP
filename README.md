# TurfJS-PHP
Bring the powerful calculation in TurfJS into PHP 

This class was created based on the source code of TurfJS

```https://npmcdn.com/@turf/turf@5.1.6/turf.js```

The purpose mainly focuses on my current project which needs to calculate how many Qude/tile (each square meters) 
can be fit in a polygon at the backend side and return a list of Qude/tile associated with their coordinate.

I HAVE NOT gotten every functions from TurfJS, so you might want to implement more :)
